# LiU — TDDE23 (2025) Labbar

This repository contains my **lab solutions** for **TDDE23** at **Linköping University (LiU)**.
It was my **first course** in the program *Civilingenjör i Mjukvaruteknik*.

Goal with this repo:
- Document my learning progression.
- Make it easy for others (e.g. recruiters) to browse my early university code.

## Structure

- `lab1/` — template file (no substantial code in this repo)
- `lab2/` — template file (no substantial code in this repo)
- `lab3/` — board represented as a dict + recursion/combinatorics (factorial / choose), with `test3.py`
- `lab4/` — recursion + simple boolean expression interpreter + binary tree helpers, with `test4.py`
- `lab5/` — image processing with **OpenCV (cv2)** and **NumPy** + provided images

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Lab 5 also needs:
  - `numpy`
  - `opencv-python` (cv2)

Example install (inside a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
